# Homework 5: Image Classification

In this homework, we will implement U-Net to perform instance segmentation on mock data. Instance segmentation is the task of detecting and delineating each distinct object of interest appearing in an image. It plays a significant role in biomedical morphological analysis (ie. Brain Tumor Diagnosis). U-Net was proposed by Ronneberger in 2015 and has since become one of the most popular ML architecture for Biomedical Instance Segmentation. You can find more information on U-Net and its application in this week's lecture.
